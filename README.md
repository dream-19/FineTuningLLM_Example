# FineTuningLLM_Example

This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune a large language model (Qwen3) using Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). It includes a Jupyter notebook illustrating the code, steps, and dependencies required to replicate or adapt the workflow.

## Contents

### `FineTuning_Qwen3.ipynb`
- Demonstrates how to load a pretrained Qwen3 model and fine-tune it using LoRA, a PEFT approach.

### Steps:
1. Loading the base model and tokenizer.
2. Using LoRA to reduce the memory footprint of fine-tuning.
3. Specifying key parameters such as:
    - LoRA rank (`r`)
    - Alpha
    - Dropout
    - Target modules
4. Example code for:
    - Training loops
    - Logging progress
    - Generating sample outputs

## Prerequisites
- **GPU** is required to execute this notebook.
- It is recommended to use Google Colab with a T4 GPU for optimal performance.
